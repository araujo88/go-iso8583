## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the ISO8583 library. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report:**

- Check the documentation for a list of common questions and problems.
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/araujo88/go-iso8583/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?**

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Provide a step-by-step description** of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include snippets of code or screenshots if you think they will help illustrate the issue.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include details about your configuration and environment:** Which version of the ISO8583 library are you using? What's the name and version of the OS you're using?

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the library's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible library
- Enable a sustainable system for the library's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Go Coding Conventions

- Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
